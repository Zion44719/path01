                <h3>Proof that I'm not a scammer</h3>
                <p> First, I can provide photo evidence of my malware/software that I use, (Brute force software,
                    phishing, ransomware, keylogger, and many more...) I don't use Protonmail because it provides US
                    authorities with user data. In addition, for all payments that exceed $1000, I propose to pay in two
                    instalments, ie 50% of the price before the start of the service and 50% of the price once the
                    service is finished.</p>

                <h3>Price</h3>
                <p>Prices depend a lot on what you hire me to do. We will discuss the project and I will provide a
                    suitable estimate with price and timing.
                    Payment is in Bitcoin, Monero or Ethereum.

                <h3>Advice</h3>
                <p>I don't advise using a popular email provider to get in touch (such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, or
                    Outlook); instead, I recommend opening a new account at: DNMX I do not recommend ProtonMail, which is
                    widely used in this environment, moreover, it does not mean that it is reliable, because it provides the
                    American authorities with user data.
